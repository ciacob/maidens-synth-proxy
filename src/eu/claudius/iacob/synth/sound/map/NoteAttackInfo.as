    /**
     * Container for all the specific information needed to produce a "noteOn" MIDI message. Data that is common
     * to several pitches (such as preset number) is not stored here, but instead it is inherited from the parent
     * NoteTrackObject. Potentially pitch-specific data (such as velocity), while inherited, can be further altered
     * via fine-tuning arguments, such as `velocityOffset`. Such arguments build upon the corresponding calculated
     * value of the parent NoteTrackObject, which, in turn, builds upon the base value of its parent Track.
     *
     * @see eu.claudius.iacob.synth.sound.map.Track
     * @see eu.claudius.iacob.synth.sound.map.NoteTrackObject
     * @see eu.claudius.iacob.synth.sound.map.TrackObject
     *
     * @param   pitchIndex
     *          The MIDI pitch to use in the produced "noteOn" message, 0 to 126, with `60` representing "middle C".
     *
     * @param   velocityOffset
     *          Offset, expressed as a percent of the parent NoteTrackObject's calculated velocity value.
     *          Only affects the related "noteOn" message.
     *          Example: `0.5` reduces the parent NoteTrackObject's velocity to half, while `2` doubles it.
     *          Out of range values will be automatically corrected. Changes are volatile, i.e., the parent
     *          NoteTrackObject's velocity value is not, itself, modified. Optional, defaults to `1`,
     *          which has no effect.
     *
     * @param   timeOffset
     *          Offset, in milliseconds, to delay or expedite (on the timeline) the produced "noteOn" message. This
     *          argument is intended to be used in implementing "arpegiatto" (strumming pitches of a chord, by
     *          giving each but the first note a slight delay). Can also increase degree of realism by deliberately
     *          avoiding precisely simultaneous note attack when reproducing chords. Positive values delay, negative
     *          values expedite. Optional, defaults to 0.
     *
     * @param   durationOffset
     *          Offset, in milliseconds, to delay or expedite (on the timeline) the produced "noteOff" message. This
     *          argument is intended to be used in implementing "arpegiatto" (strumming pitches of a chord, by
     *          giving each but the first note a slight delay). Can also increase degree of realism by deliberately
     *          avoiding precisely simultaneous note attack when reproducing chords. Positive values delay, negative
     *          values expedite. Optional, defaults to 0.
     *
     * @param   panOffset
     *          Non-standard, non-MIDI instruction to shift played ("attacked") note in stereo space. This will
     *          be directly handled at a lower-level by the synth, with no intervening MIDI messages. The argument
     *          is intended to be used with instruments that occupy a significant amount of physical space (e.g.,
     *          piano, organ, marimba, vibraphone, etc.), where stereophonically placing pitches by their
     *          frequencies makes sense, and adds to the realism of the produced sound (e.g., the lower pitches of
     *          the marimba will generally sound more "to the right" than the higher pitches of the same
     *          instrument). Works exactly like `velocityOffset` (see above) and takes parent NoteTrackObject's
     *          calculated pan value as a base. Optional, defaults to `1`, which has no effect.
     *
     * @param   tiesLeft
     *          If `true`, the "noteOn" message for this NoteAttackInfo will be omitted; combined with a `tiesRight`
     *          of `true` on the previous NoteAttackInfo of the same pitch, this will result in the implementation
     *          of a musical "tie", where a played note "holds onto" next one of the same pitch.
     *          Optional, default `false`.
     *
     * @param   tiesRight
     *          If `true`, the "noteOff" message for this NoteAttackInfo will be omitted; combined with a `tiesRight`
     *          of `true` on the next NoteAttackInfo of the same pitch, this will result in the implementation of a
     *          musical "tie", where a played note "holds onto" the next one of the same pitch.
     *          Optional, default `false`.
     *
     * @param   tieGroupId
     *          Unique identifier to apply to NoteAttackInfo instances being part of the same "tie group" (i.e.,
     *          being musically "tied" together via "tiesRight" and/or "tiesLeft"). Giving these instances a
     *          common id helps the client code treat them as a single entity (which they are, from a musical
     *          perspective, since two same-pitch notes that are "tied" sound like a single, longer note).
